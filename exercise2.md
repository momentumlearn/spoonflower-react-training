# Exercise: Shopping Cart

Build a simple shopping site using React, React Router, and Redux.

Specifics:

* Your site must show a list of products and prices. It can show images and descriptions if you want.
* Each item should have a button to buy it.
* When an item is bought, it goes into your cart.
* The number of current items in the cart should be shown on all pages.
* There should be a separate page for the cart at `/cart` that shows the list of all items in the cart and the current total. You should be able to change the quantities of the items on that page as well as deleting items from the cart.
* You should be able to switch between shopping and looking at the cart using links and routes.
* Feel free to make your own data about products. [Some sample data is included.](sample_products.json)
